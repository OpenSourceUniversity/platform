<h2>What is OSU DApp<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-osu-dapp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The OSU DApp bridges the gap between businesses and education through the blockchain. It helps all skills and certificates along with the professional experience to be stored and verified immutably by the blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Learners are able to verify their skills and expertise which will lead to increasing the chances for presenting professional opportunities which are most relevant to the candidate knowledge and interests.</p>
<p>Businesses can source talented candidates and be certain that all the skills and experiences which are verified are really gained. Companies can publish job positions and accept candidates.</p>
<p>Academy can publish courses and issue certificates. Every certificate has own set of skills and can be verified even if the certificate is issued before the creation of the platform (OSU DApp).</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h3>Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>OSU DApp: a web-based decentralized application using blockchain and IPFS technologies which have been used for immutable verification of skills, certificates, and experiences. Alpha release design is compatible for visualization on PC, laptop and mobile devices. All of the functionality is available for the end users. At that point is required to create wallet via OSU platform and to set your active profile.</p>
<p>It’s preferable to use Google Chrome browser for maximum user experience (meanwhile we are actively working for compatibility with most used browsers).</p>
<p>In the next version of the documentation, it will be created also a compatibility sheet for most used web browsers.</p>

<div class="section" id="setting-up-an-account">
<h2>Setting up an account<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-an-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There will be several steps which will describe the creation and initial setting up of an account. All the needed information is described in the sections below.</p>
<div class="section" id="create-a-brand-new-account">
<h3>Create a brand new account<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-brand-new-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By creating OSU DApp account the user has access to all the functionality on the platform. When the user lands for the first time on the platform he needs to create new wallet by clicking on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">New</span> <span class="pre">wallet</span></code> button.</p>
<p>Next step is to input email address and then click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Set</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">email</span></code> which will proceed with requesting a passphrase which needs to be filled in by the user. After agree with Terms &amp; Conditions and click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Create</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">wallet</span></code> button.</p>
<p>The next step is to show the auto-generated seed which can recover the address and it’s really important to be stored in a secure manner by the user. There is also a possibility for downloading the seed phrase by clicking on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Download</span> <span class="pre">seed</span> <span class="pre">phrase</span></code> button (<em>OSUniSeedPhrase.txt</em> file was generated).</p>
<p>After click <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Continue</span></code> button the user has to reproduce the order of all words in the seed phrase and after that wallet public address will appear. If the user made a mistake and select the wrong word he can undo the selection by clicking on the already selected word.</p>
<p>After clicking on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Continue</span></code> button the wallet was successfully created and following dialog appears on the screen. When the user see already generated public ethereum address he’s allowed to click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Create</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">account</span></code> and he will be automatically redirected to create profile view, where every user can set his active account type. Once the active type is set all the functionality of the platform is going to be unlocked. The active type could be Academy, Learner or Business, and the platform allows to easily switch the active profile by going to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Account</span> <span class="pre">Settings</span></code> secondary menu or by the top right dropdown menu on the screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging-to-users-account-which-is-already-created">
<h3>Logging to users account which is already created<a class="headerlink" href="#logging-to-users-account-which-is-already-created" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the user already has an account on the OSU DApp the passphrase can be filled in and after click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Access</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">wallet</span></code> the account will be opened. If still the account couldn’t be open by the passphrase the wallet should be recovered.  This functionality only allows the user to open his wallet <strong>without losing any information</strong> already stored into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restore-user-account">
<h3>Restore user account<a class="headerlink" href="#restore-user-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In case of forgotten passphrase already generated wallet can be restored by the seed (number of random words which are generated during the creation of the wallet). As it was already mentioned in the previous section this seed could be already downloaded into <em>OSUniSeedPhrase.txt</em> file and the only action which needs to be taken is to open the file and copy the words as it is in the empty field.</p>
<p>After clicking on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Continue</span></code> button the user will be asked to fill in the new passphrase. Than by click on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Recover</span> <span class="pre">my</span> <span class="pre">wallet</span></code> profile will be open and will contain all the information which is already imported to it.</p>
